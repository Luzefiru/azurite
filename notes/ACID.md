# ACID

>
> - ensures integrity and consistency of [[Data]], like cross-bank transactions.

## Atomicity

> [!quote] **ALL** operations either; _succeed or fail together_.

## Consistency

> [!quote] Changes made by operations are **_consistent with the [[Database]] [[Constraint]]s_**.

## Isolation

> [!quote] Multiple transactions _can happen at the same time without affecting the outcome of other_ transactions.

## Durability

> [!quote] **_Changes made by operations in a transaction will persist_**, no matter what.
