## Pros & Cons of the Database Approach

**PROS**
- Planned data [[Redundancy]] 
- Improved data consistency
- Improved data sharing.
- Enforced standards.
- Improved data quality.
- Improved [[Data-Driven Decision Making]] 

**CONS**
- new specialized personnel
- installation and management cost and complexity
- [[Data Migration]] costs
- need for [[Backup]] and Recovery
- [[Data Management]] requirements for data definitions, formats, coding, and rights to update.

## Two Approaches to Database Development

**[[Software Development Life Cycle]]**
- detailed, well-planned development process
- time-consuming, but comprehensive
- long development cycle

Prototyping
- [[Rapid Application Development]]
- an [[Agile]] development [[Framework]] for fast iterative prototypes
- quick conceptual data modeling
- definition of database during development of prototype
- repeat implementation and maintenance activities with new prototypes
