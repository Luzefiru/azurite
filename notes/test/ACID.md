# ACID

> [!info] An ACID Transaction is a group of [[Database]] operations that *either* happen **all-together** *or* **none at all**.
> - ensures integrity and consistency of [[Data]], like cross-bank transactions.

## Atomicity

> [!quote] **ALL** operations either; *succeed or fail together*.

## Consistency

> [!quote] Changes made by operations are ***consistent with the [[Database]] [[Constraint]]s***.

## Isolation

> [!quote] Multiple transactions *can happen at the same time without affecting the outcome of other* transactions.


## Durability

> [!quote] ***Changes made by operations in a transaction will persist***, no matter what.
